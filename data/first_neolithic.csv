Ghanaian Coast,,-1000,"Ozainne et al. 2014, which collates dates for the spread of pearl millet in West Africa, is the most reliable source; their work suggests a date of 1000 BC for the Niger Inland Delta and (though there is no discussion specifically for the Ghanaian Coast) also for the Ghaniaan Coast.  In Wang et al. 2014: Rice domesticated along Niger river ~1000 BC. Winchell et al. 2017: Sorghum domesticatedin 4th Millenium BC in Eastern Sudan; domesticated pearl millet in West Africa at 2500 cal BC [Manning et al. 2011]. Fuller and Stevens 2018: sorghum in Niger basin after 1000 BC. Ghallagher et al. 2018: In the Middle Senegal River Valley (MSV) [diverse micro-ecology, fairly arid], pearl millet by ~1000 BC, but sorghum rare between 800 BC and 1000 AD; rice absent."
