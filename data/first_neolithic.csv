Ghanaian Coast,,-1000,"Ozainne et al. 2014, which collates dates for the spread of pearl millet in West Africa, is the most reliable source; their work suggests a date of 1000 BC for the Niger Inland Delta and (though there is no discussion specifically for the Ghanaian Coast) also for the Ghaniaan Coast.  In Wang et al. 2014: Rice domesticated along Niger river ~1000 BC. Winchell et al. 2017: Sorghum domesticatedin 4th Millenium BC in Eastern Sudan; domesticated pearl millet in West Africa at 2500 cal BC [Manning et al. 2011]. Fuller and Stevens 2018: sorghum in Niger basin after 1000 BC. Ghallagher et al. 2018: In the Middle Senegal River Valley (MSV) [diverse micro-ecology, fairly arid], pearl millet by ~1000 BC, but sorghum rare between 800 BC and 1000 AD; rice absent."

Upper Egypt,,-5500,"Some recent syntheses for Southwest Asia, Europe, and the Mediterranean Basin: Zohary et al. 2012 and Colledge and Conolly 2007. The Levantian package of crops was established on the Nile by the ""second half of the eight millenium BP"", i.e.: 7500 - 1950 = ~ 5500 BC."

Paris Basin,,-5200,"Zapata Pena 2007: Recent bioarchaeological information has shown that domestic plants and animals were present from at least ca. 5200-4700 cal BC [along the Bay of Biscay.]"" Provisionally, take this as the start of the Neolithic in the Paris Basin."
Latium,,-6000,"Rottoli and Pessina 2007: ""By about 7000 bp (i.e., ca. 6000-58000 cal BC), early neolithic communities were established in Italy."""
Lena River Valley,,NA,"At least until very recent times, only fishing-foraging occurred."
Orkhon Valley,,-3000,"We should not consider this within the area where millet was originally domesticated (e.g., Bettinger et al. 2010). Therefore, it is sensible to date food production in the region to the arrival of horses and other managed animals. Provisionally, place the origins of food production with at 3000 BCE with Yamnaya expansions, which were very rapid on the Asian steppe."
Sogdiana,,-4500,"Food production associated with the Jeitun Culture begins in Southern Turkmenistan by 6100 BC (Harris et al. 1989; Harris 2010). According to Harris (2010), the nature of contact between hunter-fisher-gatherer groups in northern Turkmenistan and central Uzbekistan remains unclear, as does the extent to which these groups adopted food production. Further, I cannot presently access all of Harris' key 2010 book. Therefore, I provisionally place the origins of food production half way between the first Jeitun evidence and the spread of Yamarna."
Yemeni Coastal Plain,,,
Konya Plain,,-8200,"For core Southwest Asian sites we take the period 10,500 to 10,200 cal BP for the consolidation of food production. We use the end of this period as the first Neolithic in core Southwest Asia (10,200 - 1950 = ~8200 BC)."
